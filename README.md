# Face_mask_Detection
**Introduction**

Due to the Covid pandemic, face masks have become a necessity for the population for the prevention of infection  These COVID-19 masks could be potentially used to ensure the safety of us as well as others.

This has encouraged us to create a face mask detector model which can detect faces of people in the streets, in front of shops, airports or any other public place and check whether the person is wearing a mask or not.

**Methods and Modules**

The following modules are used in our code:- 
1.os
2.Numpy 
3.Matplotlib.pyplot
4.Tensorflow and Keras and its module and functions
5.Imutils
6.Scikit Learn
7.CV2
8.Time

Code has been mainly divided into 2 parts and modules have been used accordingly:
  1.Model Creation and Training Dataset 
####
Tensorflow and Keras: These modules are the most important element of the model creation. Itâ€™s functions(dense, flatten, etc.) help in training the dataset.
####
Numpy and Matplotlib: It is used to make the graph of the training health.
####
2. Image recognition:
OpenCV: CV2 is a great tool for image processing and performing computer vision tasks. It is an open-source library that can be used to perform tasks.
####

**Discussion**

With the end of our project, we conclude that our project is more efficient than other algorithms and can be used in many areas.
####
It ranges from a security webcam to a public place, helping in maintaining the norms. We have showed how AI and ML can help in resolving issues regarding healthcare.
####

**Result**

The face detection project used in many parts of the world for security matters. Better the accuracy, better the results.
